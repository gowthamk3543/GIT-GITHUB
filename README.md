**Git** is a widely adopted distributed version control system (VCS) essential for managing modifications in source code throughout the software development process. 

**A Git repository** is a location where your project resides, acting as a storage area. This repository can exist locally within a directory on your computer or on a cloud-based platform like GitHub.

**Git** is a tool for version control that enables you to monitor and record the evolution of your source code. **GitHub** is an online hosting service that facilitates the management of Git repositories. GitHub offers a user-friendly web interface along with functionalities such as permission management, task organization, error tracking, and the capability to handle feature suggestions.

**In Git, branching** allows you to veer off from the primary development path and proceed with separate tasks without impacting the main workflow. This technique enables the isolated development of features, bug fixes, or experimentation within a specific section of the repository, ensuring that each process remains distinct from the others.  
**Branch** in Git is used to keep your changes until they are ready. You can do your work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After you are done with your work, you can merge it with the main office.

While working on Git, we actively use two repositories. 
- **Local repository**: The local repository is present on our computer and consists of all the files and folders. This Repository is used to make changes locally, review history, and commit when offline.
- **Remote repository**: The remote repository refers to the server repository that may be present anywhere. This repository is used by all the team members to exchange the changes made.

**Features of Git**
- Tracks history
- Free and open source
- Creates backups
- Scalable
- Supports collaboration
